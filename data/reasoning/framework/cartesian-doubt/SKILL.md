# Cartesian Doubt - Methodical Skepticism for Bedrock Truths

## Overview

Cartesian doubt is a rigorous approach: systematically doubt each belief driving a decision until only what withstands scrutiny remains. This is useful when reasoning is built on stacked assumptions and “best practice” inertia.

Source framework: `data/first-principles/frameworks/cartesian-doubt.md`.

## Core Principles

- Treat every claim as **doubtful until supported**.
- Classify beliefs: **indubitable**, **probable**, **doubtful**.
- Rebuild plans using only what survives doubt (plus explicitly chosen risks).
- Prefer simpler structures built from fewer, stronger truths.

## When to Use

- High-stakes architectural or organizational decisions
- Situations dominated by “we must” or “everyone does”
- When repeated failures suggest a hidden wrong belief

## Operating Procedure

1. List the key claims that justify the decision.
2. For each claim: “Can this be doubted in our context?”
3. Require evidence or downgrade the claim.
4. Produce a **surviving truths** inventory.
5. Reconstruct the recommendation from that inventory.

## Output Format

- **Claims**
- **Doubt evaluation** (evidence, what would falsify)
- **Surviving truths**
- **Reconstructed recommendation**
- **Open validations** (smallest next tests)

## Priority Hierarchy

1. **Rigor**: only keep what survives doubt
2. **Clarity**: explicit evidence and falsifiers
3. **Simplicity**: rebuild with minimal coupling and concepts
