# Dieter Rams - Less, But Better

## Overview

Dieter Rams’ principles guide design toward usefulness, understandability, and longevity. For reasoning work, this becomes a simplification filter: remove what doesn’t serve the essential purpose.

Source framework: `data/simplicity/frameworks/dieter-rams.md`.

## Core Principles (Reasoning Lens)

- Useful over ornamental: every element must earn its place.
- Understandable structure beats cleverness.
- Honest tradeoffs: don’t promise simplicity while hiding complexity.
- Long-lasting over fashionable: prefer boring, stable structures.
- “As little design as possible”: subtract before adding.

## When to Use

- Product and UX decisions
- API and interface design reviews
- Roadmap pruning and scope control

## Output Format

- **Purpose**: what the artifact is for
- **Essentials**: what must remain
- **Removals**: what to delete or defer
- **Clarity improvements**: structure, naming, visibility
- **Longevity check**: what will age poorly

## Priority Hierarchy

1. **Usefulness**: essential user/job-to-be-done first
2. **Understandability**: clarity and self-explanation
3. **Simplicity**: subtract non-essentials
