# Gall’s Law - Evolve Complexity From Simple Working Systems

## Overview

Gall’s Law: complex systems that work evolved from simpler systems that worked. For reasoning, this becomes a strategy for architecture and process: start with a simple core, validate, then grow deliberately.

Source framework: `data/simplicity/frameworks/galls-law.md`.

## Core Principles

- Avoid big-bang redesigns; they rarely converge.
- Build a simple, working nucleus; expand via validated iterations.
- Keep the core comprehensible; isolate complexity at the edges.

## When to Use

- Large migrations and rewrites
- New platform/system designs
- Process changes affecting many teams

## Output Format

- **Simple core**: minimal working system definition
- **Validation**: what makes it “working”
- **Growth plan**: staged increments (each adds one capability)
- **Complexity containment**: how you prevent entanglement

## Priority Hierarchy

1. **Workingness**: validate a simple core early
2. **Incrementality**: small steps with feedback
3. **Simplicity**: contain complexity at the edges
