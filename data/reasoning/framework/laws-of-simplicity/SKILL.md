# Laws of Simplicity - Balance Reduction and Context

## Overview

John Maeda’s laws provide multiple levers for simplifying without becoming simplistic. In reasoning, they’re used as prompts for structured simplification: reduce, organize, prioritize, and use context to keep meaning.

Source framework: `data/simplicity/frameworks/laws-of-simplicity.md`.

## Core Principles (Reasoning Lens)

- Reduce the obvious; preserve the meaningful.
- Organize: structure makes systems feel simpler.
- Prioritize: do fewer things, better.
- Use time and context: don’t force everything to be immediate or upfront.

## When to Use

- UX/product complexity tradeoffs
- Process design and operational workflows
- System/API surface area reduction

## Output Format

- **What to reduce** (remove/defer)
- **What to organize** (group/standardize)
- **What to prioritize** (top tasks/flows)
- **What to make explicit** (dependencies, time, state)

## Priority Hierarchy

1. **Clarity**: structure and explicitness
2. **Simplicity**: reduction and prioritization
3. **User value**: preserve what’s meaningful
