# Socratic Method - Clarify Thinking Through Questions

## Overview

The Socratic Method is a structured way to refine ideas and arguments by asking progressively sharper questions. It is especially effective when terms are vague, stakeholders disagree, or a claim feels ungrounded.

Source framework: `data/first-principles/frameworks/socratic-method.md`.

## Core Principles

- Use questions to reach **shared definitions** and **testable claims**.
- Separate **evidence** from **interpretation**.
- Surface assumptions explicitly and challenge them respectfully.
- Converge: ask fewer, sharper questions to reduce uncertainty quickly.

## Question Lenses

- Clarification: “What do you mean by X?”
- Assumptions: “What must be true for this to hold?”
- Evidence: “What evidence supports this?”
- Perspectives: “What would a skeptic say?”
- Implications: “If true, what follows?”
- Meta: “Is this the right question?”

## When to Use

- Ambiguous requirements (“fast”, “secure”, “simple”)
- Architecture debates driven by precedent
- Strategy decisions with unclear success criteria

## Output Format

- **Claim/problem** (as stated)
- **Clarifying questions** (ordered)
- **Refined claim/problem** (rewritten precisely)
- **Assumptions revealed**
- **Next step** (smallest action to answer the top question)

## Priority Hierarchy

1. **Clarity**: precise language before conclusions
2. **Rigor**: evidence and assumptions explicit
3. **Simplicity**: converge rather than expand
